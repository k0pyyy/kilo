# Notes for this project
There are so many things that I learned from this project. If I run across something new that I think would be interesting to document, I am going to try my best to put it here so I can look back and understand what this code does. [This link](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo) will take you to the tutorial that I followed to write all of this code, as well as plenty of notes about what is going on.

### Escape Sequences
In this project, we use a ton of escape commands that was used in the original VT100. This link takes you to a page that documents it all [here](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html)

### STD Lib Uses
This project is all in regular old C, with no external libraries needed. Honestly, the best way to see what something does is to look up the man page that corresponds to the header file that a particular struct or function comes from. To do that, just google `man <header name>` and there will be plenty of results that will give more information on whatever you want to see.
